    <h1 >Ranking</h1>
    <p>First order of business in terms of the points system is to understand how points are earned. The list below is what we hammered out at the ShmooCon meeting. This is by no means final and we hope to get input on it. We want to be sure to add, change, tweak, and redesign the categories based upon the feedback from the membership. Think of a category we didn't cover? Bring it up. Think we're offering too many points for one thing or not enough for something else? Bring it up. Here are the initially suggested categories that were considered "normal" things our membership is working toward: </p>
<p>Wrote a Tool (100pts) - Pretty self explanatory. If you create a tool that is useful to the community, you qualify. While it's preferable that the tool be open source, it's not a requirement. As long as it's something you share with the community, you're good to go. </p>
<p>Wrote a Paper (100pts) - Another rather simple category. If you write and share a whitepaper on some topic, you qualify. This should be new, original material on some topic that adds value to the community. A paper on how awesome your dog is doesn't count. </p>
<p>Teach a class/workshop (100pts) - Speaks for itself. If you teach a security/info sec/IT/professional type class or workshop, you qualify.</p>
<p>Spoke at a Con (75pts) - This category is for speaking at actual conferences. We should probably define this list and add/change it as necessary. Speaking at these events push us to create new content. </p>
<p>ShmooCon
DefCon
NotaCon
ThotCon
CircleCityCon
HOPE
AIDE
????</p>
<p>Social Action (75pts) - This category is aimed at being active for the sake of some project aimed at making the world a better place to live in. This isn't meant to be a hacktivist action, though if you took place in a "To Catch a Predator" type stuff, I think that would count! This is more aimed at teaching in the community, donating time/skills for the common good (think HFC), or doing something that helps make things safer in general. Some examples:</p>
<p>Cyber Patriot
Shmooz-A-Student
Public Speaking - (NOT related to a security oriented gathering)
???
** I know there was more here from our meeting, lots of ideas but I didn't write them down. </p>
<p>Win a CTF (75pts) - Speaks for itself, no explanation needed. </p>
<p>Serving on board of Industry Org (75pts) - OWASP, ISSA, ISACA are all examples of "Industry Organizations". Serving on the board of one of these organizations takes a significant personal investment and helps to grow the community.</p>
<p>Starting/Working @ Con (50pts) - Starting a Conference is a special occasion, but working at a conference is just as important. Volunteering your time to drive or participate in the creation of a forum for the security community qualifies. </p>
<p>Compete in CTF (50pts) - Getting the brand out there, sharpening and showing your skills, meeting the competitors, and hopefully sharing the knowledge learned from the competition - all positive aspects of competing. Don' just sign up, participate. Do your best and have fun. </p>
<p>Spoke @ Industry Group (50pts) - Speaking at an OWASP, ISACA, ISSA, BSides, or other non-conference, industry related Meetup all qualify.</p>
<p>Contributed to a Tool (25pts) - Wrote a Metasploit module? Help repair a bug in SET? Write a useful Burp plug in? If you've done something to help improve an existing tool, you qualify.</p>
<p>Blog Post (15pts) - This is a highly subjective category because there is great potential to earn points, if you do it right. Writing and maintaining a personal or professional blog can be challenging. Creating content that is valid within the Info Sec community can be, at times, a difficult task. But publishing content that helps users and/or peers alike are what will qualify. Reading about your cat or your kid, while nice and fun and helpful in letting us get to know each other, don't cut the mustard. But publishing relevant information about what you're working on, what you've learned, or things you're doing within the community will be ideal. While personal interpretations of the work of others may be considered here, ideally this should be fresh, original content. </p>
<p>Went to a Con/Event (5pts) - Did you go to ShmooCon? DerbyCon? CircleCityCon? Collect 5 points. Do not pass the bar. Do not collect $200.</p>
<p>There were also a couple "special" categories that came up:</p>
<p>Mentoring a Member - This is something that allows members to recognize each other. 5, 10, or 15 points can be awarded on a quarterly basis for volunteering your time and expertise to further a member or associate's knowledge. At the end of each quarter, members can nominate members to their Capo along with a point value based upon the significance of the mentorship. This will not be contested. If a member wants to recognize another member for helping with something, the points will be awarded.</p>
<p>Maintaining a Project - 25pts will be awarded quarterly for this category. If you update a tool you've released, or something of that nature, these points will be awarded. We only discussed this briefly at ShmooCon so any input here will be appreciated. </p>
<p>Points are accumulated and a member can earn multiple categories for the same instance. An example is with Johnny competing in the SANS CTF, he would get the 50 points. If I recall correctly he won so would also be awarded the 75 points for that category. In one instance, he's eligible for 125 points. That wasn't so hard, was it? </p>
<p>With categories and values assigned, what the hell does that mean? What is the purpose of the points system? Well, the ideals behind creating this group is to push the membership toward contributing to the security community. That being said, in order to drive that, we have the "roles" to make it fun and hoping that people will want to introduce new members, rise in the ranks, and help grow the skills of ourselves, our friends, and people in general. We attempt to do that with points. </p>
<p>As of right now, no one has any official points, but we will add points retroactively for any qualifying activity since the official inception of La DoSa Nostra which was DerbyCon, 2013. Members will be responsible for submitting any request for points to their Capo. The Capos (who can use their lieutenants at will for this task) will verify the action and report the details to the Administration who will keep record of the official points. This official record will be made accessible to all members for review and audit any time. Once members start collecting points, this is how things have been ironed out to look. Again, this is open for discussion as nothing is set in stone. So if you have input, please don't hold back. </p>
<p>Once original members have 100 points, they are allowed to introduce someone to their crew as an associate. This associate is introduced and, though not a member, starts working to gather points to become eligible for membership. Associates must have 100 points before they're eligible to become a "made" member of The Family. The only known discrepancy in scoring here is that original members will have 100 points less than any future members simply because we won't be going through this first phase of membership.The idea here is that as we bring in new people, we want to make sure they're active in the community. If they're not, they'll wash out eventually. </p>
<p>Once an associate has reached 100 points, they are eligible for membership. The member who introduced the associate will nominate them for membership and the Capo will hold a vote within their crew - not the whole family. If the associate wins the vote by majority, they are accepted to be "made". There is discussion going around about creating a quarterly ceremony where the associates will take an oath of Omerta, another layer of showmanship for fun and to continue the idea of the Mafia within the group. Once "made", the associate is known as a Soldier. </p>
<p>Soldiers are the "made" men in the trenches who continue to collect points "putting in work". Soldiers need to earn 100 points, for a total of 200 points (only 100 points for original soldiers because of not going through the associate phase) to bring new members into the group or to be eligible for promotion.</p>
<p>Any Soldier with 200 points (only 100 points for original Soldiers because of not going through the associate phase) is eligible to be promoted to Lieutenant, a role appointed by Capos. Each Capo of a crew can have up to 2 lieutenants at any given time. Once a Soldier meets the point requirement, they must express interest in promotion to their Capo - it's never a mandatory thing. Capos will evaluate the Soldier's participation in LDN and will appoint their Lieutenants as they see fit. </p>
<p>If a Soldier is promoted to Lieutenant, they are committing to taking an active role in growing the membership by continuing to mentor Soldiers and helping Capos drive the crews. Lieutenants are also able to introduce a new associate into the group. Once a Lieutenant earns 400 points (only 300 for original Soldiers because of not going through the associate phase), they are eligible for promotion to Capo. If a Lieutenant is interested in this promotion, they must mention it to their Capo and/or a member of the Administration. The points will be reviewed and, barring any special circumstances, the promotion will be granted. The only way this would not happen, is if there were a unanimous veto by the administration and the existing Capos. We don't want to keep anyone from rising in the ranks but at the same time if they're out drowning puppies, we may want to have options. </p>
<p>At 400 points (only 300 for original Soldiers because of not going through the associate phase), Lieutenants are eligible to  become Capos. If the Lieutenant chooses to take the promotion, they will have the option of forming their own crew. In the event the new Capo chooses to do so, they will be able to select up to one member from every existing crew to bring into a new start up crew. If the Capo chooses not to form their own crew they are free to do their own thing, but do not get to recruit members from the other crews after the fact. In the event a Capo decides they want to start a crew after initially turning it down, they may do so by recruiting outsiders who will be expected to start at the associate level. Capos are eligible to introduce an unlimited number of associates to their crew but those associates are still expected to earn points and win a majority vote from the Soldiers in that crew in order to become made. </p>
