Last weekend, La DoS Nostra provided NOC services to [CircleCityCon], the first hackercon in Indianapolis. I worked with FrankTheTank and PhreakingGeek to design and build it. The most challenging part was coordinating time to prototype the network to test functionality as it would be used at the con.

Grap3Ap3 brought along with him some members of his CyberPatriot students. They provided great assistance in laying cable (over 1300 feet of it!) and deploying access points for the conference wifi. The network experienced good use. About 64 GBs in total were downloaded and about 14GBs were uploaded (half of that upload being IronGeek's videos.)

Apart from the network, I personally worked on procuring AV equipment and the sound system for the Saturday party with Revrance and YTCracker.  The subs were graciously lent to us from the hackerspace ClubCyberia of Indianapolis. Lab12 cones inside a very well designed 4'x4'x2' box. Altogether, each sub weighed 300 lbs and took Grap3Ap3 and myself to move about. Needless to say, the sound that evening was powerful. 

Personally, it was my first NOC setup. With FrankTheTank's guidance and PhreakingGeek's help at the con, we put on a fine network for the guests, training staff, and speakers. Can't wait to do it again!
